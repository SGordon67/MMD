Not sure where this project will go, and I'm sure it will change drastically as I go, but here's my initial plan.

Game overview:
Multiplayer missle defense game in a 2D hex grid world where missles will rain down and you must use the tools available to protect the your city.
The game will be in time steps.
The players will be able to select actions to take for each time step.
Actions must be able to select and execute quickly, as I'm imagining a time step of two or three seconds.
It's not quite real-time, but not really turn based either, somewhat of a middle ground.

Development overview:
1. Create an initial client/server model for the game to be constructed around.
2. Have a 'headless' version of the game for debugging purposes then...
3. Use OpenGL to create the visuals for the game once I can have communication between multiple players/server.
4. Implement features.

Notes:
It's my current understanding that the development path I've chosen will lead to the game only running on linux.
This is a tradeoff I'm willing to make for now, but maybe I will address that in the future.
Yes, I know there is a LOT of learning and development to get done along the way.
Each bullet point above is likely it's own project with sub-points that I will define as I dive in.

Additions:
Various types of rockets
2v2 pvp mode
